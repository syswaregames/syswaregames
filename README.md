About me
===========
My interest in technology started early, heavily influenced by my father. My father was an Information Technology teacher, and I would attend to his classes at a young age. As a teenager, I worked for him in a factory called Suloy, as a web designer. When I finished high school, I chose Computer Science as my major at University Luterana do Brasil, which I unfortunately didn‚Äôt finish. I have always wanted to start a company, which fueled an interest in business management, specifically in ERP (enterprise resource planning), what made me start Sysware and create my own ERP system.
After founding Sysware, I moved to S√£o Paulo for increased opportunity for my company. For the past 13 years I have been the CEO and lead programmer. While working, I never stopped researching and studying. I was always reading books on the subject, taking online courses, and monitoring the technology industry. It is important to mention my special interest in gaming industry, it has been a hobby since I was a child, and during my career, I created two mobile games for iOS and Android named Awesome Dogs and Skydogs.
